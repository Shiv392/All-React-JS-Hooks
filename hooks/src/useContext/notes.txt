context api is a data sending from parent to diffrent component of the application.
architechure
Root: parent-
child: A -
       B - D 
       C - E - F

we are sending some props form root component to component  A , D & E.

For A, we can direct pass props from parent to A .
For D, we can pass through B then D.
For F, we have to pass through C -> E -> F.

it is very dificult to share props among all child component so 
we uses context . 
## Context API :-
Context provides data to the tree to all component without passing it 
to manually at every level.

we made same programe for two ways, without using usecontext and by using usecontext hoks;
