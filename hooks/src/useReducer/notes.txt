useReducer also works like useState.
it takes reducer function and initial state as props and returns 
array of two values called 1.The first one is the state value, 
and the second value is the dispatch function which is further used to trigger an action with the help of array destructuring.  

syntax : 
import {useReducer} from 'react'

const [state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducer,initialstate);
